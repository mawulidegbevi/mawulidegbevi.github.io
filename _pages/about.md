Before Notre Dame, I received my bachelors in [Cell and Molecular Biology from the DePauw University](https://www.depauw.edu/academics/departments-programs/biology/), where I worked with [Dr. Pascal Lafontant](https://sites.google.com/depauw.edu/lafontantlab/home) on comparative cardiac regeneration(2018-2020). I also studied how the cellular environment played a role in regulating protein stability and dynamics(2018-2020) in Dr. Emily Guinn’s lab. During the summer of 2018, I participated in an [Undergraduate Research Internship](https://neurodata.io/about/alum.html) at [John’s Hopkins University](https://neurodata.io), where I worked with [Dr. Joshua Vogelstein](https://neurodata.io/about/jovo/)(2018). In the Neurodata Lab, I visualized and analyzed neuroimaging datasets including EEG and fMRI. 

Outside research, I enjoy making art, cooking, reading African Literature, and playing board & video games.

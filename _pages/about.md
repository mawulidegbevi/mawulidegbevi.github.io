I am pursuing a Ph.D. in the University of Notre Dame Chemistry Department in [Professor Emily Tsui's Lab](https://tsuilab.nd.edu/research/). My research focuses on modulating colloidal semiconductor quantum dot surface ligand dissociation equilibria and reduction potentials for photocatalytic applications. My works have been published in several scientific journals, including the [Journal of American Chemical Society](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.5c05413), [Inorganic Chemistry](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.4c03534), [Chemical Science](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/sc/d3sc04724e), and [Scientific African](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468227621001502).

Before Notre Dame, I received my Bachelors degree at [Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology](https://www.knust.edu.gh/), where I worked with [Professor Nathaniel O. Boadi](https://webapps.knust.edu.gh/staff/dirsearch/profile/summary/2aea1b1b19bd.html) on the synthesis and characterization of NiS thin films and evaluating their optoelectronic properties.

Outside academia, I have a wide range of interests and hobbies. I enjoy engaging in sporting activities (soccer, volleyball, pickleball, and table tennis), sightseeing, trying new restaurants, and playing board & video games.
